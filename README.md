## 3. Case Study

**TechCup** is a digital platform for managing the semester-long soccer tournament organized for the Systems Engineering, Artificial Intelligence Engineering, Cybersecurity Engineering, and Statistical Engineering programs at Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito. The system will be used by students, team captains, and tournament organizers.

The TechCup logo is available at the following [link](https://github.com/DOSW-2026-2/Requirements/blob/9e0d4cd367cad363ac73cac08c0a52b802e1b3ef/docs/TechCup_Logo.png).

In this first version of the system, TechCup must provide the basic functionality required to create tournaments and register teams for each tournament. 

The goal is to have this first version by January 2027, which means in 5 sprints (starting from the date of the lab). Note: Assume each sprint is 4 weeks long.

### Problem Description

Currently, the School does not have a centralized system that allows users to:

* Create a tournament by specifying its basic rules and information (dates, fees, etc.).
* Easily register teams for tournaments.
* Process the registration payment for each team.
* Validate payments made by teams.
* View the teams registered for each tournament.
* Generate reports on registrations for each tournament.
* Send registration payment reports in JSON format to the Dean's Office.

The goal of the system is to ensure that tournaments and registrations comply with specific rules while allowing users to interact with the platform in a simple and secure manner.

### General Business Rules

During interviews with the Dean's Office of the Systems Engineering program, the following basic business rules were identified:

* Tournaments must not last longer than one day.
* Each tournament must be identified by a unique ID consisting of exactly **five digits**, based on the year and academic semester. For example, **20262** represents the second semester of 2026.
* The possible statuses for a tournament are: **Pending, Active, In Progress, Closed, and Cancelled**.
* Only one tournament can be active at a time.
* Each team may register only for the tournament that is currently active.
* Teams must be able to pay the registration fee through **PSE**.
* Tournaments cannot be deleted.

### General Functionalities

The main functionalities of **TechCup** are:

* User authentication using username and password for TechCup organizers and students.
* **Tournament Management Module:** Authorized users (organizers) should be able to create tournaments, change their status, and update tournament information.
* **Team Management Module:** users should be able to create teams, update team information, make registration payments, and register teams for a tournament. These actions may be performed according to the user's role: **captains** can create teams, make payments, and update team information, while **organizers** can perform all actions, including reviewing payments and approving registrations.
* **View the payment made by a team:** Tournament organizers should be able to consult and verify the payment associated with a team's registration.
* **Generate a report of registered teams:** Tournament organizers should be able to generate a report containing the teams registered for a tournament.
* **Generate a report of registration revenue:** Tournament organizers should be able to generate a report of the revenue obtained from registration fees.
* **Delete a tournament and its registered teams.**

## 4. PART 1 – Project Structure (5%)

With the goal of gaining a better understanding of the different uses of Maven, you will create a project using _Maven archetypes_.

1. Create the `feature/proj-structure` branch based on the `develop` branch.
2. Create the basic project structure using the `maven-archetype-quickstart` archetype ([reference](https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/index.html)).

   1. When running the command to create the project using the archetype, make sure to define:
       * `groupId`: `edu.eci.dosw.lab`
       * `artifactId`: `DOSW-Laboratorio4`
   2. In the README.md file, write the full names of the team members and the objective of the lab.
   3. Manually add the *docs* package (including its subfolders) to obtain the following structure:

  ```text

└── docs/
    ├── uml/
    ├── images/
    ├── requirements/
    ├── planning/
```
5. Create a pull request to merge the changes from the `feature/proj-structure` branch into `develop`. The pull request must be approved by at least one team member.

    1. What was the biggest difficulty when estimating?
    2. Was it easy to reach a consensus?
    3. How did you resolve scenarios where the estimates for the same user story were not close?

6. Create a pull request to submit the changes from the `feature/estimation` branch to `develop`.
7. One of the team members will review the pull request and leave a mandatory correction comment. The comment must be: "The user stories need to be updated with the estimations defined in Jira." *(Note: If your repo communication should remain in Spanish, use the original: "Falta actualizar las historias de usuario con las estimaciones definidas en Jira")*.
8. The creator of the pull request must update the `scrum_work_breakdown.md` file with the estimations defined in Jira for each user story.
9. The team member who left the comment will review it again and give their decision to approve it or not. Important: The pull request cannot be approved by the same person who created it.
